# MyCAT

This is a computer-aided translation (CAT) tool created for the purpose of facilitating PDF translation while maintaining the original document's font size, color, and layout. The program also saves the translator's work in a modified version of the JSON format that allows for translations to be edited after the fact; with this functionality, a translator may treat their PDFs as an in-process work instead of needing to translate the entire document at one time.

MyCAT was successfully used to reduce the time taken to translate employee wellness newsletters by several hours without compromising quality or legibility.

## Example
The image below is a page taken from a translated newsletter. Translations were completed by this project's author.
